# Remote-Editing-via-Pywikibot
This is a small demo about the remote editing feature you can acheive with Pywikibot. 
## Objective
Say we have a web page about some product or some other items or even a game. What we wanna do is to fetch the statistics related to this particular item and then side - by - edit it on our web page. So for this demonstration we will be taking the Downtown 1930s Mafia Wiki and its crazy games website

To be updated later.
